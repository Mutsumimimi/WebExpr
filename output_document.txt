Straight from the polls comes our second selection for June (sorry for the delay in posting, but it's a short one so I'm hoping we can fit it in)Coraline by Neil GaimanCopied from: Publisher Comments:When Coraline steps through a door to find another house strangely similar to her own (only better), things seem marvelous.But there's another mother there, and another father, and they want her to stay and be their little girl. They want to change her and never let her go.Coraline will have to fight with all her wit and courage if she is to save herself and return to her ordinary life.Since it's all wet and rainy, let's just shoot for Au Bon Pain in Harvard Square.  There's still a slim chance I may miss this one, but will keep you posted and want to get us reading regardless Happy reading 
Again, from the polls, the next read is:Blind Woman, Sweeping Willow by Haruki MurakamiCopied from: Publisher Comments:From the bestselling author of Kafka on the Shore and The Wind-up Bird Chronicle comes this superb collection of twenty-four stories that generously expresses Murakami's mastery of the form. From the surreal to the mundane, these stories exhibit his ability to transform the full range of human experience in ways that are instructive, surprising, and relentlessly entertaining.Here are animated crows, a criminal monkey, and an iceman, as well as the dreams that shape us and the things we might wish for. Whether during a chance reunion in Italy, a romantic exile in Greece, a holiday in Hawaii, or in the grip of everyday life, Murakami's characters confront grievous loss, or sexuality, or the glow of a firefly, or the impossible distances between those who ought to be closest of all.Again, to the statue!  John Harvard's that is, in the yard.  Again, to the stairs on the right if tons of tourists, again the Au Bon Pain if it rains  And, again, my apologies, slim chance you'll have a surrogate leader   But will definitely keep you posted   If not, cell phone will be delivered so we all find each other See you then!!Lisa
