TBA
80,000
New
Yorkers
have
signed
the
petition
.

As
with
every
other
NYC
ballot
initiative
,
the
City
of
New
York
is
denying
the
will
of
its
people
to
vote
on
the
issues
it
considers
most
important.NYC
CAN
responded
by
filing
suit
,
and
on
September
9
the
City
conceded
NYC
CAN
did
in
fact
submit
enough
valid
signatures
to
put
the
referendum
before
the
voters
.

Now
NYC
CAN
is
battling
to
prove
the
petition
is
legally
valid
.

On
September
28
,
the
referee
will
report
on
the
petition
's
legality
,
and
a
final
determination
will
be
made
in
the
days
that
follow.On
the
eve
of
the
referee
's
decision
,
let
us
take
to
the
streets
in
the
THOUSANDS
on
behalf
of
the
families
,
first
responders
and
survivors
of
September
11th
and
the
80,000
New
Yorkers
who
signed
the
petition
.

As
the
climate
ripens
and
public
opinion
continues
to
swing
in
favor
of
a
new
investigation
,
this
is
our
opportunity
to
send
a
message
like
never
before
.

If
we
stand
together
,
we
can
make
history.September
