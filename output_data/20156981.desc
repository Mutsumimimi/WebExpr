Weather permitting... this place has a GREAT, large deck right on the beach in Salisbury.  Every Sunday they have a big outdoor Reggae party.  $10 cover from 4pm - 8pm.  It's a great place to hang out, dance, drink, eat and catch some rays - then it's beautiful there in the evening too!

I strongly suggest getting there before 4pm to avoid a line wait, come out and have fun just bring your smiling face and dancing feet because you will be dancing this band ROCKS!!!!
