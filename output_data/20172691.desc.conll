Just
another
warm
up
for
the
MV
Bike
Ride
...
Doc
says
I
should
n't
run
yet
so
I
have
to
ride
myself
skinny
...
so
help
me
out
.

Have
n't
decided
if
we
are
doing
the
whole
14
miles
or
just
7
...
I
guess
it
depends
on
how
long
my
day
is
...
You
can
do
whatever
you
like
though
...
You
can
bring
your
kids
but
they
should
probably
be
at
least
10
and
able
to
keep
up
.

We
're
not
going
to
race
but
we
do
n't
want
any
senior
citizens
in
their
scooters
passing
us
...
you
know
what
I
mean
?

Dinner
at
Krua
