per person
I wanted to have an out door party over the summer but I was way too busy with work and the weather wasn't so great.  So, we're going to try it in October.  The plan is to have an out door party and pot luck.  If the weather isn't good, we'll move it inside.Bring food to share and/or something to drink.  Please post with your RSVP what you will be bringing so that we won't have too much of the same thing.  Feel free to bring your favorite music too.Since this meetup is at a private location, only members that have attended at least two meetup events with this group will be given the location of the event.  The details of the location will be e-mailed out before the event.This will be a joint event with the Eastern Mass Italian Language and Culture Meetup.  I will also be collecting a $2.00 fee to help cover the expenses for the web site.See you all there!!
