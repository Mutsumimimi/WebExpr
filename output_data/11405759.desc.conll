Photographers
in
a
studio
with
models
and
hair
and
make
up
artist
-
working
out
a
Film
Noir
Style
photo
session
...
What
is
film
noir
?

It
is
a
gritty
,
contrasty
,
black
and
white
,
style
of
images
.

If
you
Google
Film
Noir
you
'll
see
a
ton
of
movies
that
were
filmed
in
this
style
-
we
want
to
spend
the
day
creating
images
that
reflect
this
style.Anyone
interested
?

We
'll
be
meeting
at
the
studio
at
9:30
to
discuss
ideas
and
how
to
make
the
images
.

We
'll
need
a
few
models
,
and
we
are
looking
for
props
like
old
dresses
,
hats
,
over
coats
,
cigaret
holders
,
anything
that
that
would
look
good
in
the
photos.We
may
need
to
chip
in
to
pay
a
makeup
artist
/
hairstylist
,
but
with
models
this
is
strictly
a
TFCD
.

If
there
is
a
MUA
that
wants
to
do
TFCD
-
then
sign
them
up
!!

Questions
should
be
directed
