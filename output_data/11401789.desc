We're sorry to keep moving around Saturday's Meetup.  However, there was an issue with Stuart's clubhouse.  We will now be meeting at Damata's in Salem.  Hopefully this will not affect your plans too much. At Damata's the food is great, as are the prices. (We do request at Meetups held at service venues that each person attending at least order one item: food or beverage.)There is also plenty of free parking. Should you be coming from outside of Salem, just remember that Damata's is on Bridge St., not the Bridge St. Bypass.Please bring your favorite board game to play.
