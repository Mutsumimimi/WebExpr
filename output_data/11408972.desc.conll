Are
you
kidding
me
?

If
Matt
Damon
is
sexy
and
suave
in
action
movies
,
he
's
hilarious
when
he
plays
a
doof
.

looks
like
a
truly
hilarious
flick.The
movie
starts
at
6:50
,
so
let
's
meet
at
6:20
in
front
of
the
theater.SUMMARY
:
What
was
Mark
Whitacre
thinking
?

A
rising
star
at
agri
-
industry
giant
Archer
Daniels
Midland
(
ADM
)
,
Whitacre
suddenly
turns
whistleblower
.

Even
as
he
exposes
his
company
's
multi-national
price
-
fixing
conspiracy
to
the
FBI
,
Whitacre
envisions
himself
being
hailed
as
a
hero
of
the
common
man
and
handed
a
promotion
.

But
before
all
that
can
happen
,
the
FBI
needs
evidence
,
so
Whitacre
eagerly
agrees
to
wear
a
wire
and
carry
a
hidden
tape
recorder
in
his
briefcase
,
imagining
himself
as
a
kind
of
de
facto
secret
agent
.

Unfortunately
for
the
FBI
,
their
lead
witness
has
n't
been
quite
so
forthcoming
about
helping
himself
to
the
corporate
coffers
.

Whitacre
's
ever
-
changing
account
frustrates
the
agents
and
threatens
the
case
against
ADM
as
it
becomes
almost
impossible
to
decipher
what
is
real
and
what
is
the
product
of
Whitacre
's
rambling
imagination
.

Based
on
the
true
story
of
the
highest
-
ranking
corporate
whistleblower
in
U.S.
history
.
