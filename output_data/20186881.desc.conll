What
we
're
doing
Neither
Monica
nor
I
can
hike
every
weekend
so
we
are
looking
for
ways
to
keep
our
legs
and
lungs
in
shape
between
our
mountain
adventures
.

The
plan
is
to
ride
at
least
once
a
week
this
summer
and
this
week
we
will
ride
along
the
Minuteman
Bikeway
.

The
Minuteman
Bikeway
is
a
former
railroad
right
of
way
that
travels
about
11
miles
through
the
historic
area
where
the
American
Revolution
began
in
April
1775
-
Bedford
,
Lexington
,
Arlington
,
and
Cambridge
.

It
offers
a
12
-
foot
wide
paved
surface
for
the
entire
length
and
offers
several
resting
stops
along
the
way
.

=====

should
be
about
22

While
I
have
been

of
my
current

for
this
trip
