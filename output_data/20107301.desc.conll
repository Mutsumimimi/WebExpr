Let
's
try
to
schedule
a
meetup
for
Source
Code
again
.

A
couple
of
my
friends
have
seen
it
and
they
said
it
was
pretty
good
.

It
's
currently
showing
at
the
West
Boylston
Cinema
for
only
$
5
.

When
decorated
soldier
Captain
Colter
Stevens
(
Jake
Gyllenhaal
)
wakes
up
in
the
body
of
an
unknown
man
,
he
discovers
he
's
part
of
a
mission
to
find
the
bomber
of
a
Chicago
commuter
train
.

In
an
assignment
unlike
any
he
's
ever
known
,
he
learns
he
's
part
of
a
government
experiment
called
the
"
Source
Code
,
"
a
program
that
enables
him
to
cross
over
into
another
man
's
identity
in
the
last
8
minutes
of
his
life
.

With
a
second
,
much
larger
target
threatening
to
kill
millions
in
downtown
Chicago
,
Colter
re-lives
the
incident
over
and
over
again
,
gathering
clues
each
time
,
until
he
can
solve
the
mystery
of
who
is
behind
the
bombs
and
prevent
the
next
attack
.

The
movie
starts
at
7:15
PM
.

Let
's
plan
to
meet
in
the
lobby
around
6:45
.

Anyone
who
wants
to
can
join
me
at
O'Connor
's
after
the
film
.

If
you
need
to
reach
me
,
send
me
a
message
or
call
my
cell
phone
at
508-981-0455
.
