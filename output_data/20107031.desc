I've heard that Bridesmaids is funny. Who wants to go?
Plot (from imdb.com): Picked as her best friend's maid of honor, lovelorn and broke Annie (Kristin Wiig) looks to bluff her way through the expensive and bizarre rituals with an oddball group of bridesmaids.
I wanted to do this at around 6:00, but it's only showing at 4:35 and 7:40. So I'm rescheduling it for the 7:40 showing. I hope it's not inconvenient for anyone. We'll meet in the lobby at 7:10. If you need to reach me, my cell phone is 508-981-0455.
Anyone who wants to can join me for food, drink, and conversation afterwards.
