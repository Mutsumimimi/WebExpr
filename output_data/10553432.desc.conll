Straight
from
the
polls
comes
our
second
selection
for
June
(
sorry
for
the
delay
in
posting
,
but
it
's
a
short
one
so
I
'm
hoping
we
can
fit
it
in
)

When
Coraline
steps
through
a
door
to
find
another
house
strangely
similar
to
her
own
(
only
better
)
,
things
seem
marvelous.But
there
's
another
mother
there
,
and
another
father
,
and
they
want
her
to
stay
and
be
their
little
girl
.

They
want
to
change
her
and
never
let
her
go.Coraline
will
have
to
fight
with
all
her
wit
and
courage
if
she
is
to
save
herself
and
return
to
her
ordinary
life.Since
it
's
all
wet
and
rainy
,
let
's
just
shoot
for
Au
Bon
Pain
in
Harvard
Square
.

There
's
still
a
slim
chance
I
may
miss
this
one
,
but
will
keep
you
posted
and
want
to
get
us
reading
regardless
Happy
reading
