Louder
Than
A
Bomb
is
a
film
about
passion
,
competition
,
teamwork
,
and
trust
.

It
’s
about
the
joy
of
being
young
,
and
the
pain
of
growing
up
.

It
’s
about
speaking
out
,
making
noise
,
and
finding
your
voice
.

It
also
just
happens
to
be
about
poetry
.

Every
year
,
more
than
six
hundred
teenagers
from
over
sixty
Chicago
area
schools
gather
for
the
world
’s
largest
youth
poetry
slam
,
a
competition
known
as
"
Louder
Than
a
Bomb
"
.

Founded
in
2001
,
Louder
Than
a
Bomb
is
the
only
event
of
its
kind
in
the
country
—
a
youth
poetry
slam
built
from
the
beginning
around
teams
.

Rather
than
emphasize
individual
poets
and
performances
,
the
string
,
critiquing
,
and
rewriting
their
pieces
.

To
succeed
,
teams
have
to
create
an
environment
ucture
of
Louder
Than
a
Bomb
demands
that
kids
work
collaboratively
with
their
peers
,
presentof
mutual
trust
and
support
.

For
many
kids
,
being
a
part
of
such
an
environment
—
in
an
academic
context
—
is
life
-
changing
.

Louder
Than
A
Bomb
chronicles
the
stereotype
-
confounding
stories
of
four
teams
as
they
prepare
for
and
compete
in
the
2008
event
.

By
turns
hopeful
and
heartbreaking
,
the
film
captures
the
tempestuous
lives
of
these
unforgettable
kids
,
exploring
the
ways
writing
shapes
their
world
,
and
vice
versa
.

This
is
not
"
high
school
poetry
"
as
we
often
think
of
it
.

This
is
language
as
a
joyful
release
,
irrepressibly
talented
teenagers
obsessed
with
making
words
dance
.

How
and
why
they
do
it
—
and
the
community
they
create
along
the
way
—
is
the
story
at
the
heart
of
this
inspiring
film
.

Special
Screening
Director
Greg
Jacobs
will
be
on
hand
after
the
screening
for
a
Q&A
at
the
showtimes
below
From
AV
Club
:
The
documentary
Louder
Than
A
Bomb
is
a
different
kind
of
high
-
school
movie
,
brimming
with
life
and
hope
instead
of
social
-
climbing
,
bullying
,
and
furtive
first
kisses
.

It
should
hit
home
with
anyone
whose
experience
of
adolescence
involved
creativity
,
intellectual
exploration
,
and
getting
to
know
and
love
people
outside
their
immediate
social
circles
.

As
the
film
is
showing
in
the
Screening
Room
,
I
STRONGLY
suggest
you
pre-purchase
your
tickets
.

This
special
screening
WILL
sell
out
:
Afterwards
,
we
'll
go
to
a
nearby
eatery
/
drinkery
(
Finale
?

Zaftigs
?

The
Pub
(
will
the
Bruins
be
playing
??!!
)

to
talk
about
the
film
and
the
best
part
of
our
high
school
experiences
.

Remember
when
people
told
us
it
was
'
The
best
times
of
our
lives
?
'

How
many
of
us
are
still
in
touch
with
our
high
school
friends
?

How
many
of
us
competed
in
creative
and
intellectual
competitions
?

How
embellished
will
the
memories
get
after
we
've
hoisted
a
few
?

See
you
at
the
movie
,
John
