From
the
bestselling
author
of
Kafka
on
the
Shore
and
The
Wind
-
up
Bird
Chronicle
comes
this
superb
collection
of
twenty
-
four
stories
that
generously
expresses
Murakami
's
mastery
of
the
form
.

From
the
surreal
to
the
mundane
,
these
stories
exhibit
his
ability
to
transform
the
full
range
of
human
experience
in
ways
that
are
instructive
,
surprising
,
and
relentlessly
entertaining.Here
are
animated
crows
,
a
criminal
monkey
,
and
an
iceman
,
as
well
as
the
dreams
that
shape
us
and
the
things
we
might
wish
for
.

Whether
during
a
chance
reunion
in
Italy
,
a
romantic
exile
in
Greece
,
a
holiday
in
Hawaii
,
or
in
the
grip
of
everyday
life
,
Murakami
's
characters
confront
grievous
loss
,
or
sexuality
,
or
the
glow
of
a
firefly
,
or
the
impossible
distances
between
those
who
ought
to
be
closest
of
all.Again
,
to
the
statue
!

John
Harvard
's
that
is
,
in
the
yard
.

Again
,
to
the
stairs
on
the
right
if
tons
of
tourists
,
again
the
Au
Bon
Pain
if
it
rains
And
,
again
,
my
apologies
,
slim
chance
you
'll
have
a
surrogate
leader
But
will
definitely
keep
you
posted
If
not
,
cell
phone
will
be
delivered
so
we
all
find
each
other
See
you
then
!!
