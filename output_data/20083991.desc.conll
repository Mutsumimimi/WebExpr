Adrien
Brody
is
in
the
latest
from
Woody
Allen
.

That
fact
alone
was
enough
for
me
to
see
Midnight
in
Paris
.

Kathy
Bates
is
also
one
of
the
cast
members
and
another
good
reason
to
see
it
.

The
movie
stars
Owen
Wilson
and
Rachel
McAdams
.

(
And
Adrien
Brody
!
)

If
you
're
a
fan
of
Woody
Allen
's
,
you
wo
n't
need
much
more
information
to
go
see
Midnight
in
Paris
,
his
forty
-
first
movie
according
to
the
Boston
Phoenix
.

I
do
miss
the
comedy
of
his
earlier
films
.

Annie
Hall
was
hilarious
.

So
was
Bananas
.

Midnight
in
Paris
combines
fantasy
and
comedy
,
and
that
sounds
good
to
me
.

Many
of
the
reviews
that
I
have
started
to
read
warn
about
giving
away
the
surprises
in
the
plot
,
so
I
'll
leave
it
right
there
.

I
*
did
*
read
a
little
farther
,
I
have
to
admit
,
but
I
would
n't
have
found
out
about
Adrien
Brody
otherwise
.

I
'll
buy
my
ticket
,
then
wait
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
from
6:30
to
6:45
p.m.
We
're
going
to
the
7:00
show
.

Midnight
in
Paris
shows
on
3
screens
at
the
Kendall
Cinema
;
be
sure
to
buy
your
ticket
for
the
7:00
show
.

Look
for
my
bright
red
backpack
.

If
you
're
late
,
you
can
find
me
in
the
theater
watching
the
previews
before
the
movie
or
the
credits
afterward
.

I
'm
reading
the
credits
for
this
one
.

If
you
do
n't
want
to
wait
in
the
auditorium
,
we
can
gather
everyone
in
the
theater
lobby
after
the
movie
.

Look
for
my
bright
red
backpack
,
no
matter
what
.

If
people
who
sign
up
for
this
event
want
to
go
out
afterward
for
tea
,
food
,
and
conversation
,
we
'll
go
to
the
Friendly
Toast
(
)
.

The
Kendall
Cinema
is
part
of
the
Landmark
Theater
chain
.

Go
to
for
more
information
about
the
theater
.

See
you
at
the
Kendall
Cinema
!
