It seems Sunday will be a beautiful day. Let's start it off with a hike.I plan to start at the Trailside Museum and start on the red dot. From there we will travel along the blue loop and wander off onto less used paths.Plan for a good 2-3 hours in the woods. Please bring enough water and snacks for you and your pets. This will be an easy hike at a decent pace. I don't plan to rush nor do I plan to stroll. Feel free to forward me an email if you have any questions. As always I will adjust plans for the desires of the group and if anyone needs to leave early I can always point you in the right direction.If you get lost or have trouble finding us please feel free to call me at 508-510-1136.
