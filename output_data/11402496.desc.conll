Lets
celebrate
together
the
most
awaited
.

.

GARBA
this
year
...
at
the
Lowell
Swaminarayan
temple
on
Saturday
.

Ok
,
so
,
people
who
had
been
to
the
Billerica
garba
last
night
did
not
have
favorable
reviews
about
it
and
said
that
there
was
hardly
any
space
and
the
music
sucked
!

And
so
I
decided
to
change
the
venue
to
the
Lowell
temple
.

The
admission
is
5
$
and
dandiya
sticks
can
be
purchased
for
4
$
.

Lowell
will
also
be
easy
to
commute
to
.

.

by
the
commuter
rail
.

Please
let
me
know
those
who
will
need
help
with
transportation
asap
.

Lets
make
a
nice
big
group
and
have
amazing
time
at
garba
this
weekend
!!!

Also
,
for
those
who
do
nt
know
how
to
play
/
dance
...
its
completely
fine
!!!

Garba
is
thrilling
enough
just
to
see
or
even
easy
to
learn
in
5
min
!!!

I
can
give
5
minute
tutorials
if
required
!!!

lolCant
wait
!!!
