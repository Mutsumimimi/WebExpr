Hi
Everyone
,
View
beautiful
fall
foliage
and
spend
a
relaxing
day
with
friends
on
the
Charles
River!We
are
planning
to
go
kayaking
/
canoeing
on
the
Charles
River
in
Dedham
on
Sunday
,
October
4th
,
weather
permitting
.

I
have
access
to
a
number
of
kayaks
and
canoes
at
Noble
and
Greenough
School
(
Nobles
)
.

There
is
no
cost
and
no
experience
is
necessary
.

See
the
photo
section
for
some
snapshots
of
last
year
's
trip
.

About
20
people
showed
up
last
year
and
the
autumn
leaves
and
scenery
were
great
.

We
had
maybe
10
kayaks
and
a
couple
of
canoes
,
and
people
took
turns
going
on
the
river
and
playing
ultimate
frisbee
.

It
's
also
possible
to
do
other
sports
,
such
as
softball
or
soccer
.

Other
people
have
access
to
the
kayaks
too
,
so
I
ca
n't
predict
exactly
how
many
will
be
available
.

Lunch
:
Pack
a
bag
lunch
and
drink
,
or
purchase
from
a
local
deli
(
We
'll
make
a
trip
for
those
that
want
to
buy
lunch
)
Picnic
tables
are
available.Wear
:
clothes
and
shoes
you
do
n't
mind
getting
wet
(
last
year
I
think
just
one
person
got
really
wet
,
but
the
inside
of
the
kayaks
are
likely
to
get
a
little
wet
.

The
water
is
not
deep
,
but
everyone
must
wear
a
life
vest
while
in
a
kayak
/
canoe.For
those
with
a
car
,
Nobles
is
located
at
10
Campus
Drive
,
just
off
Pine
St.
in
Dedham
MA
.

That
is
just
off
exit
18
,
route
128
.

See
:
www.nobles.edu
for
directions.For
those
coming
via
mass
transit
,
take
the
orange
line
south
to
the
last
stop
,
Forest
Hills
.

I
can
pick
up
people
there
at
10:30
,
but
please
let
me
know
that
you
are
coming
and
your
contact
info
just
in
case.In
the
event
of
rain
,
we
will
postpone
the
event
for
1
week
(
October
11th
)
.

Check
your
e-mail
Sunday
morning
if
the
weather
looks
iffy
.
