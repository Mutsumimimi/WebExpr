Hi Everyone,Looks like the weather will be identaical to Saturday in many ways..I STILL SEE WINDS PREDICTED  IN THE 5-10 MPH RANGE BUT WARMER TEMPS..IM  TEMPTED BUT  NOT WILING TO HAVE A SADDENING EXPERIENCE ON THE OCEAN,  ITS JUST NOT ENJOYABLE IN THE WIND..although the wind may be actually less tomorrow, a few people wrote to me indicating the sound was smoothe..not taking any chances...remember Mystic and Circle Beach, no one wanted to go through the wind to the deep..LOLPredictions then were less than 8 mph..I can only go by the predictions and make a decision based on the current weather report at the time of posting, besides its  a mixed group of recreationals and sea yaks along with different skills.. Oh well... im gonna pick and live with my choices..
