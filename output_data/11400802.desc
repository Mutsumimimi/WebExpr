One of the best towns in Masschusetts is A !mherst it is in the middle of the 5 college area.    We will have our scooters climb skinner mountain, stop at Judies where they make popovers the size of softballs and Bubbas BBQ...well you have to see it to believe it !!We will be meeting at Hess Express and take the Superslab (Mass Pike) out. We will take secondary roads on the way home....Hope to see you, Doug
