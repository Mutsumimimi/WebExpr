gon
na
do
a
warm
up
for
the
Falmouth
to
Edgartown
Bike
Ride
...
Dust
off
your
bikes
,
don
your
spandex
and
let
's
hit
the
trails
!

There
are
a
couple
of
trails
.

Each
are
about
an
hour
each
.

Whaddya
say
?

Who
's
with
me
?

Then
maybe
lunch
at
the
BBQ
joint
down
the
street
.

Paved
trails
this
time
...
they
do
have
dirt
trails
and
feel
free
to
bring
your
mountain
bike
for
side
trips
or
an
extra
ride
after
but
I
figured
,
for
the

the
paved
areas
this
time
...
Here
