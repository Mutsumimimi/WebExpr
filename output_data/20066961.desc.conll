Many
native
"
wild
"
plants
are
edible
and
nutritious
--
suitable
for
growing
in
your
home
landscape
or
found
in
other
locales
.

Come
learn
to
identify
the
species
most
suited
to
your
culinary
adventures
,
selecting
only
the
edible
portions
of
each
plant
.

Become
familiar
with
seasons
of
availability
and
guidelines
for
environmentally
responsible
foraging
.

Russ
Cohen
has
been
pursuing
edible
wild
plants
since
high
school
and
teaching
others
to
forage
for
thirty
-
seven
years

T

stop

the
Red
Line
.

I

at
the
library
between
6:00
and
6:15
.

Meet
me
inside
the
library
,
inside
the
lecture
room
.

We
may
not
be
able
to
sit
together
because
seating
is
based
on
first
come
,
first
served
,
but
if
you
ca
n't
find
me
,
my
bright
red
backpack
,
*
and
*
my
meetup
sign
inside
the
lecture
room
before
the
lecture
,
look
for
me
afterward
.

Look
for
my
bright
red
backpack
*
and
*
my
meetup
sign
.

I
've
been
hearing
that
a
lot
of
people
carry
bright
red
backpacks
,
but
how
many
of
them
are
carrying
meetup
signs
,
too
?!

If
people
would
like
to
go
out
in
Harvard
Square

we
can
do
that
.
