will
be
presenting
more
of
the
progress
and
discoveries
he
's
made
putting
the
UIGestureRecognizer
class
to
work
--
and
to
great
effect
.

He
'll
be
prepared
to
be
as
technical
or
basic
as
the
assembled
group
requires
.

So
:
Let
's
make
the
most
of
his
generous
offer
and
come
with
some
questions
,
which
he
's
probably
already
faced
and
solved
!

When
I
asked
what
might
best
help
me
get
acquainted
with
that
class
before
the
meeting
,
Zev
recommended
me
to
going
to
and
click
on
the
wwdc2010
videos
.

A
link
there
will
open
the
directory
of
videos
in
iTunes
.

The
two
related
sessions
are
:
Session
120
-
Simplifying
Touch
Event
Handling
with
Gesture
Recognizers
Session
121
-
Advanced
Gesture
Recognition
-
-
-
-
-
-
Before
that
begins
we
will
probably
have
a
roundtable
discussion
of
other
topics
.

Feel
free
to
bring
your
concern
or
discovery
and
bounce
it
off
of
or
sell
to
the
group
.

-
-
-
-
-
-
We
'll
plan
to
wrap
it
up
by
8:30
or
so
.

I
hope
you
can
make
it
.
