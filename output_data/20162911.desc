It looks like there is a chance of an afternoon shower Monday,  so we will try to get in a couple hours of play before that.
 
This will be an "intermediate and up" level meetup. It will be outdoors on a grass field.  Intermediate level means: Players with firm understanding of game strategy. Should have a good grasp of skills (passing, setting, hitting) and be able to move around to cover areas of the court. 
As always, please remember:
- Respect the RSVP system
- If it looks like you won't be able to make it or will run late please cancel your RSVP in time for someone else to join
