Sorry for the last minute posting but I hope some of you can join me.  I've read a bunch of reviews for this movie and they're all good.(500) Days of SummerJoseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel star in director Mark Weber's wry, non-linear romantic comedy about a man who falls head over heels for a woman who doesn't believe in love. Mark (Gordon Levitt) is an aspiring architect who currently earns his living as a greeting card writer. Upon encountering his boss' beautiful new secretary Summer (Deschanel), Mark discovers that the pair have plenty in common despite the fact that she's seemingly out of his league ...Reviews:  (500) Days of Summer is something seldom seen: an original romantic comedy." Los Angeles Times - Michael Ordoña "Cultural resonance aside, it's hard to imagine a more delightful, witty, well-acted and inventive comedy hitting screens this year." USA Today - Claudia Puig"It's hard to watch Summer without at times thinking of Slumdog Millionaire" and Juno, for the time-jumping structure and lustrous visual style of the former.." Variety - Todd McCarthy
