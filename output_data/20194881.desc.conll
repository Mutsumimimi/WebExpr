I
am
listing
this
member
-
run
event
on
our
site
because
a
couple
of
our
long
-
time
members
are
organizing
it
and
wanted
to
open
it
up
to
fellow
randomites
.

==========
If
you
do
n't
have
plans
for
the
Memorial
Day
holiday
weekend
and
would
like
to
get
away
and
hike
in
the
White
Mountains
you
might
want
to
consider
going
with
the
Wedelns
.

While
they
are
primarily
a
ski
group
,
they
also
do
other
outdoor
activities
and
for
the
long
weekend
they
are
looking
to
organize
intermediate
and
advanced
hikes
on
Saturday
and
Sunday
-
followed
each
night
by
barbecues
and
bonfires
.

This
will
be
a
great
intro
-
weekend
to
the
Wedeln
Ski
&
Outdoor
Club
.

If
you
have
never
been
to
their
house
then
this
is
an
ideal
weekend
to
make
your
first
visit
.

The
house
is
tucked
away
half
way
up
Hurricane
Mountain
in
N.
Conway
and
has
hiking
and
biking
trails
right
out
the
back
side
of
the
house
.

Accommodations
are
only
$
20
per
night
,
bring
your
own
bedding
.
