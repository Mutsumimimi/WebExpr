Hello!!!I apologize for neglecting this club for so long.  The summer is the busiest for me at work.  I would love to schedule a meetup dinner on Saturday night.  So, if you are at all interested.  I wont cancel at all even if there is a small turnout.  A lot of people have sent me different ideas about what they want to cook so I decided not to make a theme.  Feel free to bring what you like to cook.  It can be an appetizer, entree or dessert.  I have 8 spots available but I am willing to expand, but realistically these events tend to be small.  Please feel free to email me any questions or concerns or complaints=).  Pairing dishes with drinks is encouraged but not mandatory.  I hope to see you there.
