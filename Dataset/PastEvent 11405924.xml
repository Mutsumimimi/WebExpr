I  also hiked it earlier this summer.  I though it would be nice to try it in the fall.  This is a nice, dog-friendly hike.  It is relatively flat with only a few minor challenges. Lots of wildlife and places for the dogs to run (but bring a leash). Park on the side of the road just before or after the sign for the entrance. Bring water for yourself and your dog, and insect repellent to ward off the skeeters who may still be lurking near the watery spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The web site is :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/284_brooks_woodland_preserve.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thetrustee...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  Get thee to Petersham center to begin.  Once you are there, at Petersham center (Petersham Country Store is on corner of North Main Street and East), turn onto East street. The entrance is about .8 miles on right or left. There is, or should be, a sign there, on the left. Be sure to go past the North Common Meadow entrance (part of the same area) which is down only about .2 miles on left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If using MapQuest, or GPS/Nav systems, punch in &amp;quot;85 East Street, Petersham, MA&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hike should take about 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: The Petersham Country Store is a great place to visit before or after the hike, but it was for sale last time I was there and it may not be open anymore.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a vanilla PT Cruiser and a black lab.
